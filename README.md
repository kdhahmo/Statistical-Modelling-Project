# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### (your step 1)
- explore structure of CityBikes API
- [documentation of CityBikes API](https://api.citybik.es/v2/)
  - testing pulling data
  - having a bit of snags on accessing the data
    - need to first find the network id of San Francisco, then we can call another request with the parameters.
- so first request will contain city name and network, and I filter this out
  - and then I will use the proper network ID to make a request with all my requirements
- filter out duplicates - true duplicates
- filter out duplicates of lat long

### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges
